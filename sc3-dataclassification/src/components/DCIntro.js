                <p>
                <i>Data Classification</i> helps identify and evaluate the sensitivity, value, and importance of data within an organisation and the risk associated with the data. 
                This process is crucial for ensuring that data is handled appropriately, protecting sensitive information, and complying with legal and regulatory obligations. Data classification processes help safeguard the <b>Confidentiality</b>, <b>Integrity</b>, and <b>Availability</b> of data.

                    <p>Addressing data security can be a daunting task. ISO 27001 Annex A alone has 93 security control measures specified for securing information assets. 
                        Data Classification falls within the broader scope of Information Security Management System (ISMS) and risk management. 
                        Securing digital data assets is facilitated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) controls.</p>
                    <p>The various frameworks such as ISO 27001 provide useful checklists for implementing data classification and applicable controls. 
                        However, organisations should identify and apply the most relevant controls from these frameworks to match their specific needs rather than attempt to implement all controls blindly.
                        Information security is a capability that matures over time.</p>
                    <p>The actions for implementing a data classification process can be summarised in five steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>🔍 Identification:</strong> Identify what data you have. An inventory of all data assets should be created, including who owns the data and where and how it is stored.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It is also informative to document the data&apos;s purpose, the processes that are dependent on the data, and any applicable legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Map system and process dependencies:</strong> Identify all systems, applications, business processes, and workflows that depend on each data asset. This helps assess business impact and plan for continuity.</li>
                                <li>Data can be classified by type, such as <strong>Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>, <strong>financial data</strong>, <strong>intellectual property</strong>, <strong>healthcare/medical data</strong>, <strong>customer data</strong>, <strong>employee data</strong>, <strong>operational data</strong>, <strong>technical data</strong>, <strong>strategic/business data</strong>, <strong>regulatory/compliance data</strong>, <strong>research & development</strong>, <strong>legal documents</strong>, or <strong>marketing data</strong>, which may inform its data sensitivity classification.</li>
                                <li>Understanding the data type helps determine appropriate security controls and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR for PII, PCI DSS for payment data, HIPAA for healthcare data).</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>📊 Classification Scheme:</strong> Create a data classification scheme that defines the categories and levels of sensitivity for your data.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Common categories include <b>public</b>, <b>internal</b>, <b>confidential</b>, and <b>restricted</b>, but more complex organisations may require more granular classifications.</li>
                            <li>Each category should have clear definitions and criteria for classification.</li>
                            <li>Consider using a tiered approach to classification, where data is assigned a level of sensitivity based on its potential impact if compromised.</li>
                            <li>Cross reference the data sensitivity with the impact of the data being lost or unavailable.</li>
                            <li>The classifications should be aligned with the organisation&apos;s overall risk management framework.</li>
                            <li>Implement a process for reviewing and updating classifications as needed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>🏷️ Labelling:</strong> Label data according to its data classification.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The asset owner is responsible for labelling the data according to its classification.</li>
                            <li>Use labels aligned with the classification scheme to indicate the sensitivity / criticality level of the data.</li>
                            <li>Labels can be physical (e.g., on paper documents) or digital (e.g., metadata, file names).</li>
                            <li>Ensure that labels are visible, easily understood, and consistently applied by all users who handle the data.</li>
                            <li>Provide training and guidance to employees on the importance of data classification and proper labelling practices.</li>
                            <li>Establish a process for reporting and addressing labelling issues or inconsistencies.</li>
                            <li>Consider using automated tools to assist with labelling, especially for large volumes of data.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that labels are updated when data is moved, copied, or modified.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Implement version control for labels to track changes over time.</li>
                                    <li>Establish a process for re-evaluating data classifications when data is altered.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Capture the data classification decisions and rationale for future reference.</li>
                            <li>Capture the data classification in business requirements, processes, and procedures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>🛡️ Handling:</strong> Establish procedures for handling data based on its classification.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ISO 27001 has four categories of controls: Organisational, People, Physical, and Technological. These can be useful for structuring a data handling framework.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Organisational</strong> controls include policies, procedures, and governance structures to manage data classification.</li>
                                <li><strong>People</strong> controls involve training, awareness, and roles and responsibilities for data handling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Physical</strong> controls include secure storage, access controls, and environmental protections for data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Technological</strong> controls involve encryption, access controls, and monitoring systems to protect data.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Define roles and responsibilities for data handling based on classification levels.</li>
                            <li>Classify data on creation</li>
                            <li>Implement access controls to restrict data access based on classification - use the <strong>principle of least privilege</strong> and the <strong>separation of duties</strong> principles</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use role-based access controls (RBAC) to enforce data access policies.</li>
                                <li>Regularly review and update access permissions to ensure they align with current classification levels.</li>
                                <li>Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data.</li>
                                <li>Monitor access to sensitive data and log any unauthorised access attempts.</li>
                                <li>Establish a process for reviewing and revoking access to sensitive data when no longer needed.</li>
                                <li>Implement a process for reporting and addressing security incidents related to sensitive data.</li>
                                <li>Ensure that staff have sufficient access to the data required to perform their job functions based on their roles and responsibilities.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Develop procedures for data storage, transmission, and disposal based on classification.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that data is encrypted or protected according to its classification level.</li>
                            <li><strong>Database-specific protection:</strong> Implement appropriate database encryption (TDE, column-level, row-level security), data obfuscation (tokenisation, masking), and ensure production data protection in non-production environments through data masking, synthetic data generation, or tokenisation.</li>
                            <li>Integrate data classification into the system development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure it is considered throughout the development process.</li>
                            <li>Establish procedures for securely sharing and transferring data.</li>
                            <li>Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to protect sensitive data.</li>
                            <li>Conduct regular security training for employees on data handling best practices.</li>

                    <p>Information security is defined by the CIA triad:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Sensitivity</b> (impact of disclosure)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Preventing unauthorised access.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Criticality</b> (impact of modification and availability)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Preventing unauthorised modification.</li>
                        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring data is accessible when needed.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Data classification is determined by the &quot;High Water Mark&quot; of impact across all three CIA attributes. 
                    For the purpose of this matrix, <strong>Integrity</strong> (impact of modification) is grouped with <strong>Criticality</strong> (Availability), as both relate to the reliability of the asset for business operations.</p>
                    <p>Mitigation strategies should address:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Risks <em>to</em> the data: such as data exfiltration and unauthorised access.</li>
                        <li>Risks <em>from</em> the data: such as bias, data corruption or errors, loss, or unavailability.</li>
                        <li>Risks <em>with</em> the data: such as misuse, exploitation, ethical concerns, or compliance violations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Approaches to classifying data:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Content based:</strong> Subject to the contents and characteristics of the data, such as containing PII data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Context based:</strong> Subject to the data&apos;s metadata such as origin, location, owner, and associated business processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>User based:</strong> Manual classification by users based on their interaction and understanding of the data.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>🌐 Public:</strong> Information intended for public consumption with no risk if disclosed, and low impact if lost. (<span className="dc-risk-low">Low Risk</span>)</li>
                        <li><strong>🏢 Internal:</strong> Information for internal use where disclosure or loss causes minor to moderate impact. (<span className="dc-risk-medium">Medium Risk</span>)</li>
                        <li><strong>🔒 Confidential:</strong> Sensitive information where disclosure or loss causes significant harm or major disruption. (<span className="dc-risk-high">High Risk</span>)</li>
                        <li><strong>🚫 Restricted:</strong> Highly sensitive information where disclosure or loss causes severe damage or catastrophic failure. (<span className="dc-risk-critical">Critical Risk</span>)</li>

                    Conversely, some restricted data may be high in sensitivity but low in criticality (e.g., seldom accessed highly sensitive archives). 
                    Therefore, both sensitivity and criticality must be evaluated to determine the appropriate classification and controls for each asset.

            <p>Use this framework as a starting point for your own data classification efforts. It is not exhaustive and may fall short for some organisations and also may be overkill for others. 
                It is aimed at providing guidance on related controls to consider and requires customisation to fit your organisation&apos;s unique needs, technology landscape, and requirements. 
                In some cases a field may only allow the selection of a single option when there are multiple that apply - select the least secure option that is applicable.
                Consider what a Data Classification assessment tool should cover in terms of depth and breadth and time undertaken to perform the assessment vs what should be covered by a design.</p>
            <p>N.B. A Data Classification should be considered with respect to both Data Sensitivity (impact of unauthorised disclosure) and Data Criticality (impact of loss causing disruption to the business), which are related but distinct concepts. Careful consideration is needed to ensure the selection of appropriate security controls, access rules, and compliance measures to match.</p>
